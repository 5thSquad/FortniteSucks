  <body>
    Everyone knows Fortnite,even 3 year old child knows Fortnite.That sucks.<br>
    Many people know it sucks.But there is still people think that <br>
    Fortnite is beatiful and has so many fantasies.Because Epic(Common) Games <br>
    made it cringy and bad.Before the Battle Royale came the game wasn't that bad. <br>
    But now they are just earning money.The Idea is that people install the game <br>
    and they say "Omg Its  a Free Battle Royale" Then these people play the game <br>
    for hours and they will want to buy skins and dances because they think that <br>
    makes you pro.This is how Common Games Earn Money.
